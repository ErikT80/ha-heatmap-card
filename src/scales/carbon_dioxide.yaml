    CO₂ levels reflect the amount of fresh air in a space. High levels
    indicate insufficient ventilation. The specific effects of higher
    concentrations of CO₂ are highly individual, but studies have shown
    that levels over 1000 ppm cause cognitive impairment in many
    individuals.

    Levels over 2000 ppm have been linked to health effects in some
    studies. There is no conclusive sum of evidence.

    This scale caps at 3000 ppm, as a maximum level that'd signify
    fairly bad air. Levels above 5000 ppm are considered dangerous
    in workplace standards (f.x OSHA in the US) and are indicative
    of greatly insufficient ventilation overall.
